# Experiment 1

Description 

A Perceptron is the simplest type of artificial neural network with: 

 Input layer: Takes feature values.

 Weights and Bias: Adjusted during training.

 Activation Function: Step function (outputs 0 or 1).

 Output layer: Produces the final result.

Working of Perceptron: 

 Computes weighted sum of inputs.

 Passes it through the activation function.

 Adjusts weights using the Perceptron Learning Rule during training.

Since NAND is linearly separable, the perceptron can learn it. However, XOR is not linearly separable, 
so the perceptron fails for XOR.
