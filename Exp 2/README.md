# Experiment 2
The model has 3 layers:
1. Input Layer: These are input features and can take values of 0 or 1.
2. hidden Layer: It has 4 neurons and their weights and biases are assigned manually.
3. Output Layer: It has only 1 neuron which is used to compute the final Output.
Step Function is used as an activation function.
